# Cpp-Intro
Very First introduction to C++

### C++ Introduction
- C++ (pronounced "C plus plus") is a high-level general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. It's a superset of C language;
- A compiler is needed in order to run C++ codes;
- The C++ compiler generally ignores whitespace, with a few minor exceptions (when processing text literals);
- It's a strongly typed language;

### C++ variables
- ```int``` : integers;
- ``` double ``` : floating-point numbers;
- ``` char ``` : individual characters;
- ``` string ``` : sequence of characters;
- ``` bool ``` : true/false;
